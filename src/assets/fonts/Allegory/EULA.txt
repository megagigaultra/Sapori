This is an agreement between you, the purchaser and licensee, Barrett Reid-Maroney. By purchasing and installing or otherwise handling the digital typeface software (hereafter fonts), you accept the terms of this agreement. If you do not accept the terms, you cannot download or request or use any fonts created by Barrett Reid-Maroney.

You are granted one (1) license to use the font software on a certain number of devices within your organization. You are not receiving the copyright to the design or any other part of the fonts, but the rights to use the fonts as specified in this agreement.

“Within your organization” means usage inside your company or organization, and shall not include usage by clients or other third parties. This license allows you to use the fonts on any number of computers within your organization.

You can make archival copies of the fonts for your own purposes, counting additionally to the amount of devices you licensed the fonts for. You shall not distribute the fonts to people outside of your organization. 

You may not modify the fonts in any case. You may not commission a third party to modify the fonts. I do offer full customization service to all of my typefaces, from just a few glyphs to whole families. Please contact us with your request and I will send you a price quote for the job. 

You may not distribute, lend, rent, sell, give away, publicly or privately share any modified or unmodified version of the fonts.

If you do experience any difficulties with my fonts, I will look into the problem and hopefully send you a fixed version immediately. We do not guarantee that the font files work perfectly on every platform, operating system etc.

All purchases are final. We do not offer any refunds or exchanges for other font files. 

Any breach of the terms and conditions of this agreement terminates your license to use the fonts. After any termination of the agreement you must destroy any copies of the fonts, including your archival copies.

Any and all rights reserved Barrett Reid-Maroney
